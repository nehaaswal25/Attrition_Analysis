## Comprehensive Attrition Analysis and Predictive Modeling for HR management
 This project analyzes employee attrition patterns in an HR dataset using Python. It categorizes education backgrounds, analyzes age
 distribution, experience, salary increase, and tenure with Tata to identify key factors influencing attrition. The project implements a decision tree
 model to predict early attrition (less than 2 years) based on these factors. It provides insights on improving retention through career
 development, competitive compensation, and a positive work environment. The decision tree model is optimized using grid search and
 evaluated with precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.
